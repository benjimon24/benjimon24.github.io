<p>25 years ago, a young Chinese boy was born. He was the youngest in his family; and being the youngest, he received all the love and attention a child could ask for. In return, he showed great promise. He was well-behaved, smart, assertive, and confident. He studied hard and maintained a strong, healthy relationship with his family. Then one day, he discovered Street Fighter. This young man was no stranger to video games. Growing up with two older brothers, he was used to competing, and used to winning. He loved the thrill of competition; using skill and intelligence to outplay his opponents. But then his friend started playing Ken. Spamming shoryuken with no regard for the risks involved, this friend of his essentially turned a game of Chess into Poker. <em>Our hero's child-like sense of wonder was broken</em>. Each shoryuken that connected struck him in his very soul. After hundreds of games of Street Fighter, he has been <strong>broken</strong>. The above image is all that remains of him.</p>
