	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>His name is <strong>Luma</strong>, named after the race of star people of the Mario Galaxy franchise and the <strong>most overpowered thing in Smash Brothers.</strong></p>

	<h2>A List of my Cat's Special Abilties</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Invisibility</strong> - He can disappear at will. You will not be able to find him. He will reveal himself when he is hungry-</li>
		<li><strong>Razor Sharp Claws</strong> - These scars of mine are never going away.</li>
		<li><strong>Mind Control</strong> - He has knocked over my glass of water, trash can, and phone. He has bitten through my wires. He has shredded important documents. But at the end of the day, how can you stay mad at him?</li>
	</ul>
