			<p>So now my website looks like a cat blog so I just googled cat blog and compared my website to the first thing I found which was <a href="http://ihavecat.com/">this</a>. I looked at the source code and couldn't really figure out what was happening but I did recognize a few elements like the head, body and title elements. Everything is well organized and the website has buttons for sharing articles to other social media. It also has links to tags and authors that make it easy to organize and follow specific authors or topics. It was kind of intimidating seeing all these complex things in the source code. However, at the same time, I felt like I had a rough idea of where this course is taking me and what I will be capable of in the near future.<p>
