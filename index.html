	<h1>Say Hello to Luma!</h1>
	<p>Not sure what to put here, so I'm just going to fill it up with pictures of my cat. His name is <strong>Luma</strong>, named after the race of star people of the Mario Galaxy franchise and the <strong>most overpowered thing in Smash Brothers.</strong></p>

	<p>Here is Luma the day I first adopted him. I had to temporarily put him in the bathtub.<p>

	<p>This was taken a few months later. I received a Beefalo plush as a gift. Now it is Luma's best friend.</p>

	<p>It's getting a lot bigger now. This is what it looks like when it is sleeping. Doesn't it look so relaxed?</p>

	<h2>A List of my Cat's Special Abilties</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Invisibility</strong> - He can disappear at will. You will not be able to find him. He will reveal himself when he is hungry-</li>
			<li><strong>Razor Sharp Claws</strong> - These scars of mine are never going away.</li>
			<li><strong>Mind Control</strong> - He has knocked over my glass of water, trash can, and phone. He has bitten through my wires. He has shredded important documents. But at the end of the day, how can you stay mad at him?</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Release 1: Part 4</h2>
		<p>So now my website looks like a cat blog so I just googled cat blog and compared my website to the first thing I found which was <a href="http://ihavecat.com/">this</a>. I looked at the source code and couldn't really figure out what was happening but I did recognize a few elements like the head, body and title elements. Everything is well organized and the website has buttons for sharing articles to other social media. It also has links to tags and authors that make it easy to organize and follow specific authors or topics. It was kind of intimidating seeing all these complex things in the source code. However, at the same time, I felt like I had a rough idea of where this course is taking me and what I will be capable of in the near future.<p>
